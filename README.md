# 👋 Hi, I'm Eloy!

### 🚀 About Me
I'm passionate about **cybersecurity** and **ethical hacking**, with a focus on:
- 🔎 **Capture the Flags (CTFs)**: Competitor in events like **C3TF** and **Cibergal**.
- 🐞 **Bug Bounties**: Constantly hunting vulnerabilities and improving my web and systems security skills.
- 🛠️ **Technical Experimentation**: A big fan of **Kali Linux**, exploring as a "script kiddie" in my early days, and currently diving deep into the potential of the **Flipper Zero**.

I also enjoy working with networks, operating systems, and discovering new tools and techniques to strengthen cybersecurity.

### 🎵 Hobbies
When I'm not solving challenges or ethically breaking systems 😉, you can find me playing the drums. Music is my creative escape and a constant source of inspiration.

### 📈 Skills and Technologies
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity & Pentesting**: Proficient with tools like Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, Wireshark, and more.
- 🖥️ **Operating Systems**: Specialist in Linux (especially Kali) and Windows.
- 🌐 **Networking**: Design, configuration, and analysis of secure networks.
- 💻 **Programming**: Python is my main programming language, ideal for scripting and automating tasks in cybersecurity.
- 🎯 **Flipper Zero**: Experimenting with this versatile hacking tool.
